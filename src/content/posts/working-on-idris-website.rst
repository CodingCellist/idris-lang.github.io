As has been pointed out on the Discord, on Mastodon, and on GitHub, the Idris
website is severely out of date. It has been on the todo-list for a while, but
I'm now actively working on bringing it up to speed, as well as making it easier
to maintain going forward.

In the meantime, a banner has been added to the front and download pages,
pointing visitors to more current resources
(`pack <https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-pack>`__
and the
`Idris2 GitHub Repository <https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/>`__),
which should hopefully help reduce confusion. And on the admin side, the
GitHub Pages workflow is no longer bitrotted and the site builds again; that
should help with things.

We're (finally) on it!
