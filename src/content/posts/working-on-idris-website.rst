As has been pointed out on the Discord, on Mastodon, and GitHub, the Idris
website is severely out of date. Getting it to a more easily maintainable point
has been on the todo-list for a while now, but there has been many complications
and other priorities, especially since nobody was paid full-time to sort any of
it out.  Until now.

I'm not promising it'll be done tomorrow or anything like that, but I *am*
working on it. For now, there's a banner on the front and download pages of the
site at least acknowledging things are old and pointing people to more
up-to-date resources; I'm hoping that'll mitigate some of the continuous
confusion.

I hope that knowing there is a plan is reassuring. I can't give an exact
timeline, but expect improvements to come in the next couple of months. (For
starters, the GitHub Pages workflow is no longer bitrotted and the site actually
builds again; it's been *a while* since any of us looked at this...)
